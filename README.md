Summary:  
    We have created a user friendly system where Virginia Tech students can tutor each other for various BIT classes. Our project allows a user to create an account using their Virginia Tech email address, and either become or request a tutor.  Any user is allowed to become a tutor for any BIT class.  Users can input a class, date, and rate for their tutoring services.  Also, every user is allowed to request a tutor for any class, and they may search for tutors by class, date, and rate.  Whenever a tutor is requested, the tutor has the ability to either accept or decline each request though our system.  We have also included an administrator account, which allows us to see several reports on our system.  The reports show the total number of accounts created, accounts created by grade level, total number of requests made, the most common time requested, and number of requests according to their status (pending, accepted, declined).  
    The number of BIT student at Virginia Tech is constantly growing, and year after year BIT classes are getting larger.  Due to this, a problem arises, where BIT professors and teaching assistants do not have enough time to help each student thoroughly.  Therefore, we took this opportunity to create a BIT tutoring system for Virginia Tech.  We had two main objectives in mind when we were developing this system.  The first objective is to make sure every BIT student has the opportunity to have their questions answered, and the second objective is to allow students to tutor other students.  We felt by doing so, we would create a higher academic standard for BIT majors by creating an environment of mutual respect and also where students will assist each other for higher learning.  By creating this system, we believe that we can promote students to strive for greater academic goals.
